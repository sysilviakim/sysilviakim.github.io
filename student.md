* Here is a link to an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mbzvbbjswfbw) for final projects and papers. This LaTeX example contains how to include figures, tables, and references and is preset with class format requirements. 
* Here is a link to a [Microsoft Word template](/docs/assignment_template_kim.docx), equivalent to the LaTeX/Overleaf template above.
* Here is a [checklist for writing a literature review](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nol8hc9unx6sr8f/lit-review-checklist.pdf?raw=1).
* Here is a [basic checklist for observational studies in political science](https://yiqingxu.org/public/checklist.pdf) by Yiqing Xu.
