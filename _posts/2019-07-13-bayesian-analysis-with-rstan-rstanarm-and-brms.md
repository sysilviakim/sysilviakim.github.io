title: 'Bayesian Analysis with rstan, rstanarm, and brms'
---
I have given a public talk at the LA East R Users meetup on July 8, 2019, at the USC Health Campus. [The slides on the meetup GitHub are here.](https://github.com/laRusers/presentations/raw/master/2019-07-08_stan/larusers-kim.pdf)

A three line summary of the presentation is as follows: 

1. Never work with anything that doesn't pass HMC checks or wildly goes wrong with PPCs. 
2. Do rstanarm/brms first than lower Stan code + rstan which has good default values and built-in pathology handlings. 
3. Post things on the Stan Discourse Forum, and don't be afraid to try Stan out.
