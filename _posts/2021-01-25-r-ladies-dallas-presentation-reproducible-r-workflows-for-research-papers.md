title: 'R-Ladies Dallas Presentation: Reproducible R Workflows for Research Papers'
---
I gave a talk today at R-Ladies Dallas via Zoom. The [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dallas/events/275737054/) was recorded and a video is now available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=j4oIJCdTO8Q). The slides are [here](/figs/rladies_dallas_reproducibility_20210125.pdf).
TL;DR you should not do the following things for reproducibility within and across research projects:
1. Not working in an R project
2. Not using Git (version control)
3. Not using renv package
4. Not having a consistent directory structure
5. Messing with your raw data
6. Not having a set of ordered, modular R scripts
7. Copy-pasting code
8. Not commenting properly
9. Not writing/deploying tests
10. Not automating figures/tables

The time you spend to make things reproducible will come back to you by * not* being wasted on mending broken things later. Ping me via email or Twitter if you have additional things that you want to add!
