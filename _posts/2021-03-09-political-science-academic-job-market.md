title: Political Science Academic Job Market
---
In Oct 2020, I shared a [rough draft](https://twitter.com/sysilviakim/status/1313704814975610880?s=20) of what I wrote up as a guideline on political science R1 job market for Caltech graduate students as I prepared to graduate. Seeing how many people came up to me and said this was helpful, especially the month-to-month to-do list, I pruned and polished it a bit more and am sharing this in a fixed repository where the URL is less likely to rot.

To read the document, click this [link](/figs/ps-jobmarket-tex.pdf). Note that this is subject to the limited perspectives that I gathered from my own experiences and those around me.
