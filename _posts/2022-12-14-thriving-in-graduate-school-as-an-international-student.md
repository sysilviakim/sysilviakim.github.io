title: Thriving in Graduate School as an International Student

In Jan 2022, Melanie and I wrote a [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.33774/apsa-2022-0wqgv), titled "Thriving in Graduate School as an International Student: How to Combat the Hidden Costs and Barriers," on what are potential costs and barriers that international students face that might not be immediately recognizable. This was rejected from PS, and we have no intention to seek other outlets, but someone recently asked me whether I could make it more accessible through my website. So I'm now posting it here as well as adding it to my "Other Writings" in the CV.
