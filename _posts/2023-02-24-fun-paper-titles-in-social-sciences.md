title: Fun Paper Titles in Social Sciences
---

So there are some strong opinions about paper titles. Some are very much against cheeky, "cute" paper titles. Some hunt for the most memorable ones. Some argue that the paper title should actually deliver the bottom line of the paper up front. There's even a Twitter account called "Cliffhanger Paper Titles" (@SayWhatYouFound) that is "[s]narking on papers with uninformative titles since 2018." 

Some great titles in this "tell us what you found already" camp would be
- [Mummolo, Jonathan. 2018. “Militarization Fails to Enhance Police Safety or Reduce Crime but May Harm Police Reputation.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115(37): 9181–86.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1805161115)
- [Lockhart, Mackenzie et al. 2020. “America’s Electorate Is Increasingly Polarized along Partisan Lines about Voting by Mail during the COVID-19 Crisis.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117(40): 24640–42.](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/40/24640)

My opinion is: why not both? In a lot of cases, paper titles are better plain and informative. *Some* can afford to be memorable by having some elements of fun. Use such strategies sparingly, though.

So what are some fun, memorable paper titles in social sciences? Here's my pick in no particular order, subfields classified by journal:

#### Political Science

- [Munger, Kevin. 2017. “Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Racist Harassment.” Political Behavior 39(3): 629–49.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-016-9373-5) This one takes the cake for now.
- [Wand, Jonathan N. et al. 2001. “The Butterfly Did It: The Aberrant Vote for Buchanan in Palm Beach County, Florida.” American Political Science Review 95(4): 793–810.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305540040002X)
- [Theodoridis, Alexander G. 2017. “Me, Myself, and (I), (D), or (R)? Partisanship and Political Cognition through the Lens of Implicit Identity.” The Journal of Politics 79(4): 1253–67.](https://doi.org/10.1086/692738)

- [Mason, Lilliana. 2015. “‘I Disrespectfully Agree’: The Differential Effects of Partisan Sorting on Social and Issue Polarization.” American Journal of Political Science 59(1): 128–45.](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12089): this was John V. Kane's suggestion.

- [Fowler, Anthony et al. 2022. “Moderates.” American Political Science Review: 1–18.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422000818) A one-word title! This was Josh McCrain's suggestion.
- [Neumayer, Eric, and Thomas Plümper. 2016. “W.” Political Science Research and Methods 4(1): 175–93.
](https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2014.40) A real power move. Trouble is, this one-letter title makes it impossible to find via Google Scholar and Zotero. 

And my own, if I may:
