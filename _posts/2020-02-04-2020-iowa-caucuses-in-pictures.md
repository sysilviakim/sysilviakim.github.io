Thanks to the [2020 Iowa Caucus Conference](https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/Shambaugh-2020Caucus) hosted by [Caroline Tolbert at the University of Iowa](https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/people/caroline-j-tolbert), I have been able to see the rallies, the field office operations, and ultimately the 2020 Iowa caucuses myself. Here are some of the pictures that captured the storm.
