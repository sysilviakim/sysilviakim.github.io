Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at American University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020. 

I work on American politics, political methodology, and computational social sciences, with emphasis on political behavior, election administration, and money in politics. In addition, I build methods to calculate and address measurement biases in administrative data and surveys.
