Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Seoul National University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020, and was formerly at American University as an assistant professor, 2020--2023, and at Sogang University, 2023--2024. 

I work on American politics, political methodology, and computational social sciences, with emphasis on political behavior, election administration, and money in politics. In addition, I build methods to calculate and address measurement biases in administrative data and surveys.

My work has been published in [American Political Science Review](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422000983), [Political Behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09816-z), [American Politics Research](https://doi.org/10.1177/1532673X19870512), and others.
