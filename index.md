Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science and International Relations](https://psir.shoplic.site/wp/en/home-eng/) at Seoul National University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020, and was formerly at American University as an assistant professor, 2020--2023, and at Sogang University, 2023--2024. 

I work on American politics, political methodology, and computational social sciences, with an emphasis on political behavior, election administration, and money in politics. I also build methods to calculate and address measurement biases in administrative data and surveys.

I have publications at the [American Political Science Review](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422000983), [The Journal of Politics](https://doi.org/10.1086/735435), [Political Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2024.33), [Political Behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09816-z), and others. You can find a copy of my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9g6jjc4odrxwur6/kim-cv.pdf?raw=1) and my Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lbvTrNIAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

p.s. I used em-dashes before generative AI came in. I won't be apologizing for my continued usage of em-dashes!
